# Content Blueprint AI (Flagship) 💡

The **Content Blueprint AI** actor is your public-facing creative engine, transforming raw market and social intelligence into ready-to-use, multi-platform content ideas and blueprints. It sits at the final stage of the **AI Content Intelligence Ecosystem** pipeline.

## Core Functionality

This actor combines trend scores, keyword strategy, and sentiment analysis (from upstream actors) to generate structured creative assets using the best GPT-5 LLM Model.

### Generated Outputs

For every trending topic processed, the actor generates actionable content tailored to the selected platform:

* **TikTok Scripts:** Focus on virality with clear hooks, visual cues, and optimized hashtags.
* **YouTube Concepts:** Provides click-worthy titles, high-retention 5-point outlines, and production tone suggestions.
* **Blog Article Outlines:** Generates SEO-optimized titles, compelling introductions, key H2 section headings, and a call-to-action (CTA).
* **Ad/Marketing Copy:** Produces short and long-form copy specifically utilizing the `best_strategy` (e.g., 'Highlighting risk' or 'Aspirational vision') derived from keyword analysis.

## Phased Ecosystem Dependency (IMPORTANT)

This actor requires a source of initial intelligence to function. **The minimum requirement to start the pipeline is one external news data actor.**

* **Current Dependency:** At launch, the pipeline requires one downstream news data actor (e.g., a GDELT or specialized news scraper) to successfully feed the initial topics to the **Topic Trend Aggregator Actor**.
* **Expansion Plan:** We will initially rely on one required category (e.g., Global Markets Intelligence) and then gradually integrate more news pipelines into the Topic Trend Aggregator's input for richer data and wider coverage.
* **Long-Term Logic:** The goal is to evolve the **Content Blueprint AI** into a true orchestrator that will attempt to run the pipeline automatically if no existing dataset is found, ensuring a successful run outcome.
